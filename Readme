School Management Project Overview
Description
This School Management Project is developed using Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to manage student information and their academic marks. The system facilitates the storage and retrieval of student details and their corresponding marks in various subjects.

Features
Student Details: Capture and store student information such as name, roll number, grade, etc.
Subject Marks: Record marks obtained by students in different subjects or courses.
Database Connectivity: Utilizes JDBC to establish connections with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
User Interface: Utilizes console-based interaction for data input and retrieval.
Functionality
Adding Students: Ability to add new student records with their details.
Updating Records: Allows updates to student details or marks.
Viewing Information: Capability to view individual student information or subject-wise marks.
Data Storage: Saves student data and marks in a relational database for persistent storage and retrieval.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for project development.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Facilitates interaction with the database for data storage and retrieval.
Relational Database: Utilizes a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store student information and marks.
How to Use
Setup Database: Ensure the database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) is set up with the necessary tables and columns to store student data and marks.
Compile and Run: Compile the Java program containing the School Management System and execute it.
Interact with Console: Follow the console-based instructions to add/view/update student details and marks.
Purpose
The project aims to demonstrate the usage of JDBC for database connectivity and basic CRUD operations, providing a simple yet functional system for managing student information and academic marks in a school environment.

Notes
This project is developed as a learning exercise and showcases the integration of Java with a relational database using JDBC.
